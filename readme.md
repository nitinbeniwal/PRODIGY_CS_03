# Password Complexity Checker

## Overview

The Password Complexity Checker is a simple Python tool that assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria. It provides feedback on whether the password meets certain requirements such as length, uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. This can help users create more secure and robust passwords.

## Features

- **Length Check**: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
- **Uppercase Check**: Verifies that the password contains at least one uppercase letter.
- **Lowercase Check**: Verifies that the password contains at least one lowercase letter.
- **Digit Check**: Ensures there is at least one numeric digit in the password.
- **Special Character Check**: Looks for at least one special character from a specified set (e.g., @$!%*?&).

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python password_checker.py
   ```
4. Enter a password when prompted.
5. View the assessment results in the terminal.

## Example

```bash
Enter a password to check its strength: P@ssw0rd

Password Strength Assessment:
Strength: Strong
Meets Length Requirement (8 or more characters): True
Contains Uppercase Letter: True
Contains Lowercase Letter: True
Contains Digit: True
Contains Special Character: True
```

## Customization

Feel free to modify the criteria or feedback messages to better suit your needs. You can adjust the regex patterns or the minimum length requirement in the script.
